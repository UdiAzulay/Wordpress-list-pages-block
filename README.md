# ua-list-pages-block
add wordpress Gutenberg block to allow display child pages in various ways

Well, I had to configure wordpress tempate and could not find any free plugin to show child pages/posts with thumbnails.

theres are a few free short-code plugins but a shotcode is somehow old way to edit page content.

So i had to make this plugin (with al the sadness, becouse it took some reasonable amount of time to understand the framwork and implement it just to allow this basic functionality)


i hope it will help some one,

just upload the and install nortmally

tested on wordpress 5.3, php 7.3
